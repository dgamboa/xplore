# Xplore

## A way to plan and track your web browsing-based learning

Back when I attended Dev Bootcamp, I was looking for ways I could track the non-linear learning I was experiencing as I progressed through various challenges and exercises. This consisted of reading Stack Overflow posts to solve issues I encountered along the way, referencing various algorithm books and conversations with instructors about gaps I identified as key bottlenecks in my progress.

As I thought about this, I figured I should have a way to track and quantify these learning data points in a way that could become meaningful for optimization over time.

## Project Shelved since 2013

I decided to shelf Xplore in 2013 to focus on other projects.
