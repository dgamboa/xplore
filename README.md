# Xplore

### Xplore is a side-project to create an alternative education system designed with humans in mind, not dogma.

There are two sets of mockups.

First I created hand-drawn mockups of the primary parts of the application. That lives [here](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/mockup/mockup.html).

I then began to create live mockups in HTML for a [home page](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/home/index.html) and a [content-browsing interface](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/learn/learn.html).

Moving forward, I plan to first make a decision on what technology to use to build it (Backbone, Node, Rails). Consequently, I will start the build as follows:

1. Learning interface without persistence (users can take notes but must export to CSV to save them)
2. Write a Chrome (~50% market share) browser extension to test whether it's better than the web page interface
3. Integrate into whatever framework we will use for the backend so that users are able to save their learning (tracking, notes, etc) in the application
