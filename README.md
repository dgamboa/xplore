## A way to plan and track your web browsing-based learning

There are two sets of mockups. First I created hand-drawn mockups of the primary parts of the application. Those live [here](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/mockup/mockup.html).

I then began to create live mockups in HTML for a [home page](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/home/index.html) and a [content-browsing interface](http://dgamboa.com/xplore/learn/learn.html).

### Learning UI

Moving forward, I plan to first make a decision on a building approach (Backbone, Node, Rails). Consequently, I will start the build as follows:

1. Learning interface without persistence (users can take notes but must export to CSV to save them)
2. Write a Chrome extension to test whether an extension interface is better than a web page interface
3. Write the backend so that users are able to save their learning (tracking, notes, etc) in the application
4. Allow users to browse each other's learning profiles/histories
5. Write user-to-user interaction functionality (Perhaps by integrating with Facebook/Google APIs)
